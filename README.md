# Paint-Project
This is the paint project that was made for my grade 11 computer science class and it is programmed in python. I converted it to an exe so it can be run without having to download python. It is based on One Piece and also has some keyboard short-cuts.

In order to set it up please do the following:  
#1: Download the Final Paint Project.rar folder.  
#2: Download the paint.exe file.  
#3: Decompresss the Final Paint Project.rar that holds are the images and other cool stuff.  
#4: Drag the paint.exe file into the Final Paint Project folder that has been decompressed.  
#5: Run the paint.exe file and have a blast!

Extra Credits:
I coded the entire thing; however, all the images, music, and GIFs belong to their rightful and artistic owners. Without those fantastic people, this project would not have been the way it is now and I thank them.
